	include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
	within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
	pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
	of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed

	of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
	do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
	notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
	or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
	that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
	as modifying the License.

	You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
	may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
	for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
	for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
		reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
	the conditions stated in this License.

		8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
		whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
		unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
	negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
	liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
		incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
	result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
	Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
		work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
	other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
	has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

		9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
	the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
		and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
		or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
	License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
	on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
	of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
		defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
	incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
	of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.
